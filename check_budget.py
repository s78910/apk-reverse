"""Budget and shape gate for the apk-reverse skill: keep the always-loaded part from creeping,
and keep the long parts navigable.

`check_repo.py` proves the repository is *consistent* (paths resolve, indexes are complete).
This proves it is not *bloating*, and that a reader can find their way into a long file. Those are
different failures, and the second has no natural counter-pressure: every pass adds a reference, an
index row and a coverage claim, and nothing in the repository notices.

What is measured, and why each measure is shaped the way it is:

  1. **The always-loaded part, in tokens rather than lines.** A skill's whole `SKILL.md` body loads
     into context when the skill activates (agentskills.io/specification, "Progressive disclosure"),
     so every line of it competes for attention -- **including the index tables**. An earlier version
     of this gate subtracted the index lines from the budget, which made the number look better than
     the context actually is: 150 index lines are still 150 lines the model reads. The budget is now
     measured on the whole file, reported in lines *and* estimated tokens, with the index share
     reported for context rather than credited against the budget.
     Line counts are kept because they are the number a human can check by hand; the token estimate
     is `characters / 4`, which is crude and stated as crude -- it is a trend indicator, not a
     measurement of a specific tokenizer.
  2. **Index row length.** The index tables are the largest part of `SKILL.md` and the easiest to
     grow by accident: each new entry is written by someone who knows the detail, and the detail
     lands in the row. An index row says *when to load the file*; the file says what is in it.
  3. **Restated conclusions** (reported as notes, never as failures). A conclusion legitimately
     appears in the benchmark matrix, in the evidence record, and in the coverage statement --
     those three exist to state results. The check flags a concept that has spread *beyond* those
     homes, because that is when a future correction has to hunt for every copy.
  4. **Reference discoverability.** Every reference must be reachable from SKILL.md or nothing will
     ever load it. (`check_repo.py` also enforces this; the duplication is deliberate, because a
     dead reference is invisible in a way a broken path is not.)
  5. **Long-file navigability.** A file over `NAV_LINES` that a reader cannot skim is a file they
     will not load. Each one must open with a navigable head -- a "what this answers" line and
     either a table of contents or a "when to load" line -- so the decision to read further can be
     made from the top. This is the check that keeps "file-level progressive disclosure" from
     becoming a claim the repository makes but does not implement.
  6. **Instruction strength** (a note, never a failure). The repository's rules are meant to be
     followed, not weighed: a rule phrased as "consider X" reads as optional and is skipped under
     load. This reports the ratio of hedging phrases to imperative ones as a *trend*, and lists the
     hedged lines it found, so a human can decide -- the gate cannot judge whether a given sentence
     should be optional.
  7. **Corpus size** (a note, never a failure). The checks above govern what every task *loads*; this
     reports what the repository *carries*. The first cannot see the second: a new reference costs
     exactly one index line, so the corpus can double while the always-loaded count stays green. A
     large corpus is a choice; a growth nobody measured is the defect.

Usage:
    python check_budget.py            # report; exit 1 if a hard limit is exceeded
    python check_budget.py --strict   # treat every warning as a failure
    python check_budget.py --json

    `characters / TOKENS_PER_CHAR`.

    The fallback constant is **calibrated against that measurement** rather than guessed: a
    markdown-heavy document tokenizes worse per character than the usual /4 rule of thumb, and this
    file measured 0.30 characters-to-tokens on SKILL.md (67,011 chars -> 19,929 tokens).

    Why the value matters more than the method: the first version used 3.6 and the gate therefore
    reached *different verdicts on different machines* -- `WARN over budget` where tiktoken was
    absent (CI's 3.11 job, and any contributor's box) and `ok` where it was installed. A budget gate
    whose answer depends on what the runner happens to have installed is not a gate. Calibrating the
    fallback to the same ballpark makes the verdict agree, and the printed `how` field still says
    which number a reader is looking at.
